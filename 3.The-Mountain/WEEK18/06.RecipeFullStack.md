Hellow there... how're you doing today ?

We will tackle our last project on React with a complete fullstack app of a Todo list with **authentication** and **data persistence in a database**

But... wait! We won't be implementing a backend by ourselves. Instead, we're gonna use a BAAS (Backend As A Service).

BAAS are plateforms that handle the authentication and database management automatically through a nice interface.

Almost all of them have CLI's that work with React so you just have to install the package and call its methods to authenticate and perform CRUD.

There are several of them. One very used and established is Firebase. One of the first to do this.

But Firebase ir proprietary (it belongs to Google) and therefore you are depending on their business model. If they raise the price, well... there is nothing much to do about it. If one day they decide to shut the service down... well... Too bad for you and your projects.

That's why companies are more and more migrating to open source BAAS like Supabase.

Another very insteresting BAAS is Appwrite, a growing open source one. They all have a business model of hosting their baas for you, but because it's open source you can host them yourself.

We will be using Appwrite because it's easy to use and, anyway, they all work in a similar way.

The goal :

- Create a nice and beautiful (Tailwind) React app that demands the user to be logged in to create recipes in their profile.

- Use the authentication system of Appwrite to perform the register/login. (email is the simplest one, but it would be awesome to give the possibility to login with Gmail or another service)

- Use the database model of Appwrite to store the recipes

- Use the bucket system of Appwrite to upload a cover picture of the recipe.

- For the recipes :

  - An upload field for the cover picture
  - A field for the title
  - A field for a description
  - Several fields (that can be added) for the ingredients with quantity and name.

- When a recipe is created, you should see it in your dashboard. And you also will have to implement logic in order to chose for how many people you want the quantity of the ingredients to be.

If you code this thoroughly and with dedication, that could be a very nice asset to your portfolio. So... Go for it !!!!

Good luck, my friends !
