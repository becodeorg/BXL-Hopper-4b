# Project : Stop Watch

---

In this first project, we will create a small app of a **stopwatch**.

- The stopwatch should display the minutes, seconds and centiseconds.
- We must have a **START**, a **PAUSE**, a **RESET** and a **LAP** buttons.
  - **START** starts the counter, that refreshes every centisecond. (10 times a millisecond). (Once it's started, the text should be **RESUME** and can't be clicked)
  - **PAUSE** stops the counter without reseting it. **RESUME** should be able to resume it.
  - **RESET** resets the counter to 0.
  - **LAP** displays the exact time when we clicked (the counter continues without stoping)

In this project, you will be led to master :

- useEffect
- useState
- Being able to set the state from previous state
- Establish logic with setTimeout, etc.

Good luck, my friends !
