# Project : Markdown reader

---

In this project, we will have a `textarea` input where we can write markdown and next to it see the result in html.

Bonus : Create some buttons `heading 1`, `heading 2`, `bold`, `italic`, `horizontal line`, etc. to insert automatically the markdown syntax in the `textarea` to facilitate de writing of the markdown.

In this project, you will be led to master :

- the librarie `marked`
- the insertion of html in a react component (`dangerouslySetInnerHtml`)
