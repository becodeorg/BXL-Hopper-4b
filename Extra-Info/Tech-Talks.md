# Tech talks

Tech talks are a moment of 10 to 15 minutes, each day after the break, where you will give a presentation (or live code, demo...) about anything tech related.  
Possible subjects are tech news, programming languages, how to manage a server... You get the idea!

When in doubt if something is suitable for a tech talk, feel free to ask your coach.

## Add to MyBeCode

Go to MyBeCode > events > add event (tech talk).
Make sure to add all your talks there, we'll use this information to keep track of everything.

## Order of the tech talks

Always be prepared for the next 3 tech talks.  
This means that if you have a tech talk on Thursday, you should be able to give your talk on Monday.

A failure of all 3 juniors to give a tech talk will lead to collective homework!

## Tips

### Practice

- Practice the beamer/projector at least once
- If it's remote, practice sharing your screen on Discord
- Practice what you are going to say at least once, preferably with someone listening

### Slides/other media

- Use the pointer device so you can advance slides without being at your laptop
- Or have someone else do the slides
- DO NOT USE THE LAPTOP YOURSELF, it makes your presentation 10x worse if you do it yourself because you will be talking down, won't be heard as well, you'll struggle doing things cause of the stress, ...
- So do yourself a favor and ask someone else to handle the switching, playing, slides, ...

### Ask questions to the audience

- As introduction to new things: 'What do you know about X?'
- To keep people interested: 'But why would they do X like this?'
- To know if they are getting what you are saying: 'Which of these is correct?'
- Write down those questions and think of the possible responses
- What if the audience doesn’t know what to answer? Guide them or drop it?

### Content

- Make a long presentation, then cut stuff that is bad/boring
